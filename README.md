# Magic Draw
Super powerful drawing app for 3DS!

## ✨ Features
- Canvas support up to 1024x1024px
- Brush, Eraser, Fill tools
- Various brush types
- 4 layer functionality
- Blend modes
- Save/Load
- PNG export
- ...and more

## ⚠️ Known Issues
- **It probably won't work on the old 3DS due to memory capacity issues!!** (I plan to support it in the future)
- Saving/Loading/Previewing can be very slow on large canvases (It can take several minutes on large canvases)
- Performance is slow on large canvases (Hiding unused layers may improve it somewhat)
