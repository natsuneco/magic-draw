## ⚠️ Known Issues
- **It probably won't work on the old 3DS due to memory capacity issues!!** (I plan to support it in the future)
- Saving/Loading/Previewing can be very slow on large canvases (It can take several minutes on large canvases)
- Performance is slow on large canvases (Hiding unused layers may improve it somewhat)
